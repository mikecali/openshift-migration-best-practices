# Planning

This section focuses on considerations to take into account when you plan your migration.

## Overview

MTC performs migrations via a 2 step process of:

* Step #1 - Source cluster:   Backup to Object Storage
* Step #2 - Target cluster:   Restore from Object Storage

The following are processed in a migration:

* Kubernetes Resources
    * All namespaced resources are processed, including Custom Resources.  MTC performs a dynamic discovery of all API resources in each referenced namespace.
    * Some cluster scoped resources are processed.  If a namespaced resource references a cluster scoped resource it will be processed.  For example this would include: Persistent Volumes bound to a Persistent Volume Claim, Cluster Role Bindings, and Security Context Constraints
* Persistent Volume data
    * 2 options exist for processing Persistent Volume data
        * Move:  For remote storage (example: NFS) that is accessible by both source and target, it may be possible to only ‘move’ the PV definition from source cluster to target.  This is quickest way to handle PV data migration
        * Copy:  2 methods for 'copying' exist
            * Snapshot:  For storage providers that support snapshots and have a Velero VolumeSnapshotPlugin configured (AWS, Azure, Google) it’s possible snapshot a volume assuming other requirements are met such as same storage/cloud vendor, clusters in same region, etc.
            * Filesystem Copy:  For all other storage use-cases a filesystem copy serves as the generic means of being able to copy data from a source PV to a destination PV.  This is the mechanism to use when changing storage classes in a migration, it grants most flexibility.
* Internal Images
    * Internal images such as the result of `s2i` builds will be processed during a migration.  Each ImageStream reference in a given namespace will be copied to the destination cluster's registry.

## When to use MTC

In an ideal scenario migrating an application from one cluster to another would be a redeploy of the application from a pipeline and perhaps copy of persistent volume data.  For many situations this may not be sufficient as a running application on the cluster may have had adhoc changes done to it over some period of time and it's drifted from the initial deploy.  MTC is designed to handle those cases when a user is not sure exactly what is in a namespace and they want the entire contents migrated to a new cluster.

Our general recommendation is if it's possible to redeploy your application from a pipeline proceed with that option, if not leverage MTC

## Alternative Tools in Upstream

In addition to MTC, there are 2 tools in upstream which may be of interest for larger scale migrations to help only with migration of PVs and Images.
* `pvc-migrate`: https://github.com/konveyor/pvc-migrate
* `imagestream-migrate`: https://github.com/konveyor/imagestream-migrate

The alternative upstream tools are written to be smaller focused tools that are easier to comprehend and debug opposed to Golang based Kubernetes controllers.  The tools leverage a mixture of Ansible + small Python snippets + rsync/skopeo.  

If these tools are used, they would be leveraged by:
1. Run MTC in a configuration that skips processing of PVs and Images
    * Example, in the MigrationController Custom Resource on the host cluster set the below values:
        ```
        disable_image_migration: true
        disable_pv_migration: true
        ```
1. Execute `pvc-migrate` and/or `imagestream-migrate` as per upstream documentation it is expected that MTC would be run in a configuration of skipping processing of pvs/images and the alternative tools would be run

### When to consider using alternative tools vs MTC

 * Large scale migrations
    * ~50+ ImageStreams per Namespace
    * Multiple ~100GB+ Persistent Volumes to be copied

 * Requirements for alternative tools
    * Direction connection available between source and target cluster, i.e. a process on each Node of the source cluster is able to connect to an exposed Route on the target cluster.
    * The host executing pvc-migrate has root ssh access to each Node of the source cluster
    * For pvc-migrate, OCS 3 -> OCS 4 is the only supported path.  No other storage providers are implemented.

 * Considerations of MTC vs alternative tools
    * Serial processing: MTC processes 1 Plan at a time and 1 Backup/Restore operation at a time
        * MTC plans to address this in future to allow parallel execution
            * Related to future contributions in Velero via [velero-#487](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/487) 
        * Parallel Image migrations are possible using imagestream-migrate
    * Double copy:  Each MTC migration consists of at least 2 copy operations:  Backup copy and Restore copy
        * Alternative tools are a direct single copy from source to target, they don't need to do the 2-step backup/restore process.
    * Ease of debugging/customizing behavior
        * MTC is a collection of golang Kubernetes controllers working together to orchestrate Velero to perform a series of Backup and Restore operations.  Debugging a failure may be challenging, it can span different clusters, namespaces, and controller logs.  In addition, customizing MTC behavior requires golang updates and recompiling code and updating the operator to deliver.
        * Alternative tools leverage Ansible, a small amount of python snippets when essential, and standard tools of rsync and skopeo.  Users are more likely to have a familiarity with Ansible and be able to debug problems and/or customize behavior as they need.
            * An example we've seen in past has been when doing large migrations at scale and running into filesystem corruption issues.  Leveraging `pvc-migrate` with rsync, it is fairly easy to see the rsync error from a corrupted source file and reason through the fix, then address on source volume and re-migrate that PV.  

## Source environment

The following considerations apply to the OpenShift 3 source environment.

### TLS

* Termination types
  * Passthrough
  * Edge
    * Minimal amount as this is managed by the cluster by default
  * Re-encryption
    * Where does the certificate originate?
    * Corporate CA
    * Self-signed certificates
  * Update to routes
* CA certificates
  * Reading PEM files
  * Embedded certificates

### Routing

* Traffic traversal between clusters

### External dependencies

* Ingress/Egress

### Images

* Migrating the internal image registry
* Prune the image registry before migration
* TBD: unknown blob error in registry (perhaps related to NFS)

### Storage

* An intermediate object storage is required to act as a replication repository for the CAM tool to migrate data
* Source and target clusters must have full access to the replication repository
* Create a migration plan to copy or move the data
* TBD: Velero does not over-write objects in source environment. Link to Velero documentation.

## Target environment

The following considerations apply to the OpenShift 4 target environment.

* Creating namespaces before migration is problematic because it can cause quotas to change.

## Migration strategies

### Stateless Applications * Big Bang migration

* Applications are deployed in the 4.x cluster.
* If necessary, the 4.x router default certificate includes the 3.x wildcard SAN.
* Each application adds an additional route with the 3.x hostname.
* At migration, the 3.x wildcard DNS record is changed to point to the 4.x router VIP.

![BigBang](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-migration-best-practices/raw/master/images/migration-strategy-bigbang.png)

### Stateless Applications * Individual migration

* Applications are deployed in the 4.x cluster
* If necessary, the 4.x router default certificate includes the 3.x wildcard SAN.
* Each application adds an additional route with the 3.x hostname.
* Optional: The route with the 3.x hostname contains an appropriate certificate.

For each app, at migration time, a new record is created with the app 3.x fqdn/hostname pointing to the 4.x router VIP. This will take precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

![Individual](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-migration-best-practices/raw/master/images/migration-strategy-individual.png)

### Stateless Applications * Individual canary-release-style migration

* Applications are deployed in the 4.x cluster
* If necessary, the 4.x router default certificate includes the 3.x wildcard SAN.
* Each application adds an additional route with the 3.x hostname.
* Optional: The route with the 3.x hostname contains an appropriate certificate.

A per app VIP/proxy is created with two backends: the 3.x router VIP and the 4.x router VIP.

For each app, at migration time, a new record is created with the app 3.x fqdn/hostname pointing to the VIP/proxy. This will take precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

The proxy entry for that app is configured to route X% of the traffic to the 3.x router VIP and (100-X)% of the traffic to 4.x VIP.

X is gradually moved from 100 to 0.

### Stateless Applications * Individual audience-based migration

* Applications are deployed in the 4.x cluster
* If necessary, the 4.x router default certificate includes the 3.x wildcard SAN.
* Each application adds an additional route with the 3.x hostname.
* Optional: The route with the 3.x hostname contains an appropriate certificate.

A per app VIP/proxy is created with two backends: the 3.x router VIP and the 4.x router VIP.

For each app, at migration time, a new record is created with the app 3.x fqdn/hostname pointing to the VIP/proxy. This will take precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

The proxy entry for that app is configured to route traffic matching a given header pattern (e.g.: test customers) of the traffic to the 4.x router VIP and the rest of the traffic to 3.x VIP. More and more cohorts of customers are moved to the 4.x VIP through waves, until all the customers are on the 4.x VIP.
